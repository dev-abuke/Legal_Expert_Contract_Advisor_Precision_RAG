Withholding Rights. (a)\\tNotwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each of the Buyer or anyone acting on its behalf, the Paying Agent, the Escrow Agent and the Section 102 Trustee and any other applicable withholding agent (each a “Payor”), shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Closing Cash Payment and from any other payments otherwise required pursuant to this Agreement, such amount in cash as the Buyer and/or such anyone acting on its behalf is required to deduct and withhold with respect to any payments under the Code or any provision of state, local, provincial or foreign law, unless the applicable Payee (as defined below) provides the Payor, at least five days prior to the proposed date of such payment, with a valid withholding certificate obtained from the applicable tax authorities, exempting the payment to such payee from withholding tax or reducing the amount thereof. To the extent that the amounts are so deducted or withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid or issued, as applicable, to such Payee in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made and, upon request, the Payor shall promptly provide the applicable Payee with a document evidencing the amount so withheld and remitted to the Tax authority with respect to the payment made to such Payee. Notwithstanding the above provisions, with respect to Israeli Taxes, and in accordance with the Paying Agent undertaking provided to Buyer as required under Section 6.2.4.3 of the Income Tax Circular 19/2018 (Transaction for Sale of Rights in a Corporation that Includes Consideration that will be Transferred to the Company Stockholders at Future Dates) (the “Paying Agent Undertaking”), any consideration payable or otherwise to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement on the Closing to any Company Securityholder (other than holders of 102 Securities) or any other Person entitled to payments hereunder (each a “Payee”) will be retained by the Paying Agent, for the benefit of such Payee for a period of up to 180 days from the Closing Date or as otherwise requested by the ITA (the “Withholding Drop Date”), during which time such Payee may obtain a valid certificate or ruling issued by the ITA in form and substance reasonable acceptable to Buyer and the Paying Agent, which: (i) exempts Buyer and the Paying Agent from the duty to withhold Israeli Taxes with respect to such payment to Payee, (ii) determines the applicable rate or amounts of Israeli Taxes to be withheld from the payment due to such Payee, or (iii) provides any other instructions regarding the payment or withholding with respect to the applicable portion of the consideration due to such Payee as determined by the ITA (the “Valid Certificate”). The Paying Agent will act in accordance with the provisions of any Valid Certificate to Buyer and/or the Paying Agent, provided such Valid Certificate is provided not later than three Business Days prior to the Withholding Drop Date. If a Payee (i) does not provide Buyer or the Paying Agent with a Valid Certificate at least three Business Days prior to the Withholding Drop Date or (ii) submits a written request to the Paying Agent to release such Payee’s payment prior to \\u200ethe Withholding Drop Date without submitting a Valid Withholding Certificate, then the amount to be withheld and transferred to the ITA from the amounts payable to such Payee will be calculated according to the applicable withholding rate as reasonably determined by Buyer and the Paying Agent. Such amount will be delivered or caused to be delivered to the ITA by the Paying Agent, and the Paying Agent will release to such Payee the balance of the amount due to such Payee that is not so withheld. In the event that a Payor receives a written demand from the ITA to withhold any amount out of the amount held by such Payor for distribution to a particular Payee and transfer it to the ITA prior to the Withholding Drop Date, such Payor (i) will notify such Payee of such matter reasonably promptly after receipt of such demand, and provide such Payee with reasonable time (but in no event less than 7 days, unless otherwise required by the ITA) to attempt to delay such requirement or extend the period for complying with such requirement as evidenced by a written certificate, ruling or confirmation from the ITA, and (ii) to the extent that any such certificate, ruling or confirmation is not provided by such Payee to the Payor prior to the time required by the ITA, will transfer to the ITA any amount so demanded, including any interest, indexation and fines required by the ITA in respect thereof, and such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been delivered and paid to such Payee. Any withholding made in Israel New Shekel (“NIS”) with respect to payments made hereunder in USD will be calculated based on the Exchange Rate on the most recent Business Day preceding the payment date, and the applicable Payee shall bear sole and exclusive Liability for any foreign currency conversion fee or commission or other fee, cost, Tax, duty or charge applicable to the conversion of such amount from USD to NIS, which such amount shall be deducted from payments to be made to such Payee. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, with respect to holders of Options who are individuals and are not Israeli residents for Israeli Tax purposes, who were granted such awards in consideration solely for work or services performed entirely outside of Israel (and who will provide Buyer and Paying Agent, prior to any payment to them, no later than three Business Days before such payment is due, with a validly executed declaration in the form attached hereto as Exhibit [●] regarding their non-Israeli residence and confirmation that they were granted such awards in consideration solely for work or services performed entirely outside of Israel), such payments will not be subject to any withholding or deduction of Israeli Tax and, to the extent such individual are employed by the Company at the time of payment, will be made through the Company’s payroll payment system. If such declaration is not provided at least three Business Days prior to the day of the applicable payment, then such payment will be subject to tax withholding as will be reasonably determined by Buyer or the Paying Agent.'],\n",
